# PS-PROFILE
A profile script for your Powershell that added helpful methods to start up your powershell profile. 

## Setup:
From a command prompt, load the profile script into your favorite text/code editor.

e.g. [visual studio code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)  
`PS>code $profile`

Copy and paste the contents of the [profile.ps1](./profile.ps1) file into your open editor. 

Save the changes, close and reopen your powershell window. If you copied the file as is:
1. your prompt would have changed 
2. added a new cmdlet `New-Powershell-Window` or it's alias `psw`
